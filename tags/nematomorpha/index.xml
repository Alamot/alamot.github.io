      <description>Did you know that there are parasites that can manipulate the behavior of their host organism? The hairworms is such an example. Hairworms are long thin, wormlike parasites. Their scientific name is Nematomorpha. They parasitize mostly on insects, like crickets for example. Crickets are living on the land but hairworms can reproduce only in water. Therefore, hairworms have to «drive» their host towards water bodies. Most times this results in the death of the host because crickets get drawn themselves.</description>
