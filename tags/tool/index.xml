      <description>Let&#39;s say we XOR-encrypt a text file using this &#34;secure&#34; password/key: @v3RyS3cREtK3y!
We should not forget that:
plaintext ⊕ key = encrypted_text encrypted_text ⊕ plaintext = key  If the key is smaller than the plaintext, the key is repeated. This fact makes this encryption scheme extremely weak.
In practice, the above equations mean that if we know a part of the initial plaintext, then we can retrieve part of the key relatively easily.</description>

      <title>MSSQL shell with file upload capability</title>

      <description>Sometimes we can get access to a Microsoft SQL server in which the execution of the xp_cmdshell stored procedure is allowed but other kind of traffic (TCP, UDP, ICMP et.c.) is blocked by some kind of firewall. This can make the acquisition of a shell more difficult. In such cases, it would be useful to have a kind of shell via multiple xp_cmdshell commands. One problem with that approach is that every xp_cmdshell command will be executed in a new context.</description>
