      <description>My Bachelor&#39;s thesis in Biology was about developing a consensus method for the prediction of amyloidogenic determinants in globular proteins. Several studies suggest that not all regions of a polypeptide chain are equally important for determining its aggregation tendency. It seems that protein aggregation is mediated by short aggregation prone segments. These aggregation nucleating regions can be detected in the sequence of a protein in silico based on physicochemical principles (phenomenological models) or/and molecular simulation approaches.</description>
