      <description>Sometimes we can get access to a Microsoft SQL server in which the execution of the xp_cmdshell stored procedure is allowed but other kind of traffic (TCP, UDP, ICMP et.c.) is blocked by some kind of firewall. This can make the acquisition of a shell more difficult. In such cases, it would be useful to have a kind of shell via multiple xp_cmdshell commands. One problem with that approach is that every xp_cmdshell command will be executed in a new context.</description>
